# The Amulet of Ages: A Text-Based RPG

## 📖 Concept

Welcome to "The Amulet of Ages," a text-based roleplaying adventure! You are an adventurer tasked with investigating a spreading darkness that threatens the kingdom. Your journey will take you from haunted forests to the imposing castle of a cursed king, where your choices will determine the fate of the land.

## ✨ Features

* **Character Creation**: Choose from three unique classes: the stalwart **Warrior**, the cunning **Rogue**, or the powerful **Mage**.
* **Dynamic Stats**: Your stats (Strength, Agility, Magic) directly influence combat and your ability to overcome obstacles.
* **Turn-Based Combat**: Engage in classic turn-based combat. A simple dice-roll mechanic (1-20) determines the success of your actions.
* **Inventory System**: Collect, manage, and use items, from healing potions to legendary weapons and quest artifacts.
* **Branching Narrative**: Your decisions matter. The game features multiple unique locations and decision points that lead to one of three distinct endings.
